Django Create App:

What is an App?

An app is a web application with a specific purpose in your project, like a homepage, contact form, or database of members.

In this tutorial, we'll create an app to list and register members in a database. But first, let's make a simple Django app that displays "Hello World!".

Create App:

Name the app (e.g., members).

Navigate to your chosen location (e.g., my_tennis_club folder).

Run this command:

Copy code
py manage.py startapp members
If the server is running, press [CTRL] [BREAK] or [CTRL] [C] to stop it and return to the virtual environment.

Django creates a "members" folder in your project:

markdown
Copy code
my_tennis_club/
    manage.py
    my_tennis_club/
    members/
        migrations/
            __init__.py
        __init__.py
        admin.py
        apps.py
        models.py
        tests.py
        views.py
These files and folders have specific purposes that you'll learn about later.

Take a look at the "views.py" file. This is where we gather information for proper responses.

This gives you a concise understanding of creating a Django app.
