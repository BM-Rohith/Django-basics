Django Views:

Views:

Django views are Python functions handling HTTP requests and returning HTTP responses, often HTML documents.
A Django-powered web page consists of various views with distinct tasks and purposes.
Views are typically stored in a file named views.py within your app's folder.
Defining a Simple View:

In your my_tennis_club/members/views.py file:

python
Copy code
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def members(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello world!")
Note:

The view name doesn't have to match the application name; in this case, it's named members.
This simple example demonstrates sending a response back to the browser.
Using Views:

To execute the view, it must be accessed through a URL.

Choosing Between HttpResponse and render:

Use HttpResponse to create a basic response with custom content (e.g., plain text, JSON).
Use render when generating dynamic HTML responses via Django templates and passing data to those templates.
The choice depends on the view's specific requirements and how you structure the response content.
This summarizes the key points about Django views and how to create and use them for responding to requests.
