Customizing the Django 404 (Page Not Found) Error Page:

When you try to access a page that doesn't exist in your Django project, you may encounter a 404 error. Django provides a way to customize the appearance of the 404 error page.

Step 1: Check the Default 404 Error Page:

In your web browser, type 127.0.0.1:8000/some_nonexistent_page/ in the address bar.

You will see the default built-in Django 404 error page.

Step 2: Customize the 404 Error Page:

Create a file named 404.html in the /templates/ folder of your members app:

html
Copy code
my_tennis_club/members/templates/404.html
Add your custom HTML content to the 404.html file:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<title>Page Not Found</title>
<body>

<h1>Oops!</h1>

<h2>I couldn't find the page you're looking for.</h2>

</body>
</html>
This content will be displayed when a 404 error occurs.

Step 3: Test the Custom 404 Error Page:

In your web browser, type 127.0.0.1:8000/some_nonexistent_page/ in the address bar again.

You should now see your custom 404 error page with the content you added.

Note: The steps provided here are for demonstration purposes on your local development server. In a production environment, you might want to provide more detailed error information for debugging purposes, and you should consider implementing a more user-friendly error page for your users.
